# HASH-Destroyer
It is a tool that has its own wordlist and if you'd like to add your own wordlist you can. This tool checks if the hashed text or password and tries to get the answer of it so using the default wordlist you may not find it but using your custom wordlist and it finishes the processes extremely fast.
